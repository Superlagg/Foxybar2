This is an dialog element that'll be used in a furry dating sim RPG game I'm working on!
Its called "Furry Love" and its a game where you can date furries and go on adventures with them!
There's a lot of dialogue that'll be rendered in a vertical chat pane
so I'm testing out how it'll look in the browser!

The element will have a div container flexbox that holds two divs:
1. The TopDiv, which will be a secondary flexbox container that holds:
- The character's profile picture, which will be on the left
- The picture will be a circle with a border radius of 25%
- The picture will be 25px by 25px
- The RightDiv, which will be a secondary flexbox container that fills the rest of the space, and holds:
- The character's name at the top
under the name will be two buttons, arranged horizontally:
- a button that Opens the character's profile
- a button that Sends a message to the character
2. The BottomDiv, which will be a normal div, alligned to the left, that holds:
- The header line for the character's dialogue
- Something like "Feel Me Up Foxie whispers to you,"
- The character's name will be in bold
- The action will be in italics
- The whole line will be underlined
- What the character says
The entire element will span the width of the browser window, and will stack on top of each other
Kinda like an app chat pane! :D
The TopDiv will be locked to 25px in height
the BottomDiv will stretch to fit the text inside it
The vertical size of the element will try to use as little space as possible
All CSS will be inline for now, but I'll move it to a separate file later
